## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started

Though in its infancy, the Tech Blog version 1 has a backend that will go on to support a fully functional front end in version 2.  
### Dependencies

* bcrypt
* sequelize
* dotenv
* express
* express-handlebars
* mysql2
* nodemon

### Victories

Working with the MVC format was a good experience, and felt familiar. In seeking direction with instructional videos and reverse-engineering similar projects, the Models, Controllers, and concepts behind Views felt familiar to work with.

### Challenges

Ultimately, the hard stop was in finding connection errors between database and servers. 
CSS has also been a long-time challenge, but I have noticed steady improvement that will be implemented in version 2.

### Next Steps

In order to realize the full functionality of the app, the following will still need to be done:

* fix connection errors
* initialize database
* finish public javascript and CSS styling
* finish front-facing code for Views. 
* serving the website on Heroku
